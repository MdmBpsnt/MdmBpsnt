**`Computer Science Enthusiast & Learning Programmer`**

Hey, my name is Chloe! I'm an aspiring programmer, learning to code one line at a time. I've been passionate about computers and how they work from a very young age. whether it's custom building pc's, exploring how different software functions, or writing my own programs. If it's related to computers, then I love it!
